# v0.5.0 Pre-Release Roadmap

A rough feature set grouping for each v0.5.0 preview release.

*Note: It may or may not make sense to do minor bugfix preview releases along the way (e.g. 1.0 -> 1.1).*


## Pre-Release 1.x
* Scan SeedQR / CompactSeedQR
* Set passphrase
* View seed words w/configurable warnings
* Export xpub w/configurable warnings and flow determined by Settings
* Scan PSBT
* Full PSBT review screens
* "Full Spend" (no change) warning
* Fully verify PSBT change addrs
* Send signed PSBT via QR
* Subset of configurable Settings w/persistent storage
* SettingsQR integration proof-of-concept

Screens will be functional but not necessarily in their final presentation state (icons, text, positioning, etc).


## Pre-Release 2.x
* Existing screen refinement (visual presentation, text, etc)
* Create new seed via image entropy
* Manual mnemonic seed word entry
* 12th/24th word calc
* SeedQR/CompactSeedQR manual transcription UI
* Single sig address scan and verification


## Pre-Release 3.x
* Further existing screen refinement
* "Final" bugfixes
* Create new seed via dice rolls
* Custom derivation paths in xpub export flow
* Multisig wallet descriptor QR scan(?) and addr verification(?)


## Initial v0.5.0 Release
All of the above!
