## The Open Pill Mini Enclosure

The "Open Pill Mini" is simply a smaller version of the original "Open Pill" that is designed to incorporate a more compact camera specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero -- this enclosure is just about as small as a SeedSigner can conceivably get. It is pictured below, alongside the original Open Pill enclosure.
