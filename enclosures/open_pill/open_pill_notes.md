## The Open Pill Enclosure

The "Open Pill" was the second officially released SeedSigner enclosure. Given some of the challenges associated with the "Orange Pill", the Open Pill was designed for quick, inexpensive, and simple deployment. No secondary hardware components are required for assembly and the design consists of a single printed part that can be produced with even basic 3D printers. This simpler design was intended to put the focus back on the project's software, which was improving by leaps and bounds when the enclosure was released.
