Hello World!

I am new to programming and new to GitHub, but here is a simple program to calculate the word 24 checksum from the first 23 words of a bitcoin wallet seed phrase! 

The code is designed to be run on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a Waveshare 1.3" 240x240 pxl LCD (more info at https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.3inch_LCD_HAT).

I will flesh out this readme as work on this continues (to included a step-by-step process to install the necessary dependencies) but for people more advanced than myself who would like to give it a go, I've published the first version of the code.

My code calls on the ST7789.py file, which was provided by the manufacturer.

My code also calls on this repot: https://github.com/diybitcoinhardware/embit/blob/master/src/embit/bip39.py

There are other packages that my script calls on, but you find them in my script for now!

more coming soon!
